                        Hi there, I'm Joan Uribe and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to introduce myself. 
                        Looking back at the past 10 years, I realize that I've held a variety of titles that have taught me invaluable skills and given me unique experiences. 
                        I started out as a Marine Corps Tiltrotor Crew Chief, where I learned about the importance of attention to detail, teamwork, and adaptability. 
                        Later, I became a mentor and basic and tactics flight instructor, which allowed me to hone my communication and leadership skills.    
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-1">
                        After my time in the military, I pursued higher education, while simultaneously working in a variety of fields, including yoga instruction, car sales, and caregiving. 
                        These experiences have given me the ability to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and adapt to different environments.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-1">
                        During my time in school, I discovered a passion for learning, and specifically, an interest in website and mobile development. 
                        As I learned more about these fields, I realized that web development was the career path that I truly belong in because I know that there will always be more to learn. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-1">
                        Currently, I have skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, Bootstrap, jQuery, and WordPress. 
                        I have also started learning more advanced concepts like SASS, React, and Node.js. 
                        I earned my certificate in Computer Studies: Web and Mobile Front-End Development from Santa Rosa Junior College, where I'm currently pursuing my Associate's degree in Computer Studies. 
                        In the future, I plan to transfer to a Bachelor's program in software engineering to continue expanding my knowledge and experience in the field.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p-1">
                        I am eager to take on new challenges, collaborate with others, and constantly improve my skills as a web developer. 
                        If you have any questions or would like to work together, please don't hesitate to contact me directly using the Contact page on my portfolio website.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-12 p-1 p-md-2">
                    <h3 class="text-center p-3 border-bottom border-3">Why You Need Me!</h3>
                    <p class="pt-3">
                        As an employer, you need someone on your team who has a passion for learning and a desire to continually improve their skills. 
                        That's where I come in. I possess a genuine curiosity for how things work and am constantly seeking new knowledge and understanding. 
                        Whether it's exploring new technologies or asking questions to better understand a project, I am always striving to learn more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my passion for learning, I am not afraid to seek help when needed. 
                        I understand the importance of collaboration and know that asking for assistance can lead to more innovative solutions. 
                        This willingness to seek out help and work effectively in a team environment is a strength that I bring to any project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my strongest assets is my ability to approach projects with passion and commitment. 
                        When I'm working on a project, I give it my all and am dedicated to delivering the best possible results. 
                        I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations, and I always strive to go above and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, I believe that my passion for learning, collaborative mindset, and commitment to excellence make me a valuable asset to any team. 
                        I am excited at the prospect of contributing my skills and expertise to your organization and am confident that I can make a meaningful impact on your projects.
